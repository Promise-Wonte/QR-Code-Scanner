### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

my major learnings while working through this project is some css styling properties that helped me position my QRcode properly nad make it responsive.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
<div class="my-code"></div>

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color:  hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}



### Continued development

Working on this project made me realized that my knowledge on CSS is very slim and it opened my mind to a broader aspect of CSS i should focus on and improve my myself.
 I hope to focus more on responsiveness of my projects and other unique properties that would make my project readable and apealing to my users. These are concepts or techniques i found useful that i want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [CSS TRANSITONS AND FLEX](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me to understanding CSS flex and transition. I really liked what i have learned and will be using it going forward.
